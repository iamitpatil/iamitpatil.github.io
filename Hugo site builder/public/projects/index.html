<ul>
<li>Worked on comparison of leading Mutual Fund houses on their performances across various sectors over past 5 years</li>
<li>Analyzed associated Risk factor using parameters like sharpe ratio, alpha, beta, standard deviation</li>
<li>Studied the impact of macroeconomic factors on the fund performances and compared the houses on their vulnerability</li>
<li>Created a fuzzy model to assess mutual funds against their respective benchmarks using time series analysis</li>
<li>Assigned ensembled scores to houses based on above criteria to finally declare best performer</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="competitive-strength-of-atm-operators-jan-2017-march-2017-link"><a href="link">Competitive strength of ATM operators        [Jan 2017 - March 2017]</a></h5>

<ul>
<li>Performed Quantitative analysis based on the number of cardholders, number of Merchants and the number of ATMs in each area</li>
<li>Implemented SOA (Strength, Opportunity, Aspiration) analysis technique for qualitative analysis of all three competitors</li>
<li>Proposed a 2-stage scoring system by using zip codes demographics, influence of locality of ATMs on the number of transactions</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="visualizing-and-modelling-the-likeability-of-consumer-packaged-goods-jan-2016-march-2016-link"><a href="link">Visualizing and modelling the likeability of Consumer Packaged Goods     [Jan 2016 - March 2016]</a></h5>

<ul>
<li>Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to provide insights on key performance measures and fragrance attributes of the products</li>
<li>Used logistic regression to predict the probabilities of liking of the products leading to identify the factors affecting the likability</li>
<li>Used an ensemble vote of forward and backward stepwise selection method and information gain to identify 7 important features</li>
<li>Improved the cross-validation AUC-ROC from 0.73 to 0.85 by creating new features from the existing features in the dataset</li>

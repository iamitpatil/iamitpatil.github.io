I am Amit Patil. I am a mechanical engineering graduate from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.  I am currently employed by Big Data Automation Startup Infoworks as a software engineer at Bangalore. I work with Platform team at infoworks to implement backend services.

I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
